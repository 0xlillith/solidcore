# Findings

Rust-vs-C++ disagreements, upstream bugs, nondeterminism and other facts later agents
need. Add entries under a heading per unit (or "General"); keep the newest at the end
of each section.

## General

- **Nondeterministic upstream paths.** `SmFace::GetPointsInFace` (asked for more than one
  point) and `SmShell.cpp` call `srand(time(NULL))`. Those paths can't be reproduced bit for
  bit. Difftests must avoid them, or compare only results that don't depend on the random
  draw. The Rust port draws from `kernel.rng` instead. (Reported by Wave 0 agents B and C;
  see `plan/closure.md` for the other hazards: pointer-keyed maps, global tolerances, and
  statics set by the first call.)
- **NLib global error record.** NLib routines return a flag and store the error number in
  the process-wide `NL_ERROR.eno` (`N_ErrSet`). Shims must call `N_ErrClear()` before the
  call and read `NL_ERROR.eno` after it. On the Rust side this is
  `SolidError::Nlib { code: NlibCode, .. }` (added to `crates/solidcore/src/error.rs` with
  `nlib.knots`). Normalise both sides to `nlib_<number>` in runners.
- **JSON can't hold NaN or inf.** difftest inputs are JSON, so generated cases can't contain
  non-finite parameters (serde turns NaN into `null`). Test robustness to non-finite input in
  Rust unit tests. Outputs may still be non-finite.
- **difftest report `seeds` field.** It records the `--seeds` CLI value, not the number of
  generated cases a runner actually produced. `nlib.knots` overrides `cases()` to always
  generate at least 1200.

## nlib.knots (green; no disagreements)

2953 default cases and a 51,753-case run (`--seeds 50000`) all agree bit for bit with
upstream (`max_rel_err = 0`). Upstream behaviour worth knowing:

- **`N_BasisEval` with a flag other than `NL_LEFT`/`NL_RIGHT`.** It ignores the
  `NL_CAL_ERR` from `N_BasisFindSpan` and reads an uninitialised span index (UB). Rust
  takes a `Side` enum, so this can't happen. The ffi wrappers reject other flags.
- **Out-of-bounds reads on short knot vectors.** Upstream span and basis routines read
  outside `U` when `m < 2p+1` (and `N_BasisEval` overflows its stack arrays when
  `p > NL_MAXDEG + 1`). Rust returns `SolidError::InvalidInput` for these. The ffi wrappers
  only pass inputs with `n_knots >= 2p+2`.
- **`N_BasisEval` on `NL_NUM_ERR`.** Upstream leaves `N` partly computed. Rust returns only
  the error. A later port that relies on the partial values would need a different API.
- **NL_LEFT/NL_RIGHT docs contradict the code.** The upstream comments say `NL_LEFT` means
  `U[spn] < u <= U[spn+1]`, but the code does the opposite: `NL_LEFT` gives
  `U[spn] <= u < U[spn+1]`. Rust `Side` documents what the code does.
- **`N_KnotVectorIsValid` accepts degenerate vectors.** It accepts a vector of `p+1` equal
  knots (for example `[2,2,2,2]` with p=3), and a single knot with p=0. Rust does the same,
  faithfully.
- **Zero-length end spans are skipped.** `N_BasisFindSpan` moves the end spans inward past
  zero-length spans (`U[i+1] < U[i] + 1e-12`, upstream note [B405]). `find_span_and_mult`
  therefore reports multiplicity `p+1` at the domain ends, whatever the real end
  multiplicity is.

## topology.database_io (green; no disagreements)

2059 default cases (59 fixtures over `Surface.sms`, `MakeFace/ApproximateSphere.smp`,
`Tess/Extrusion.pbp`, `Tess/BoxFillet.stl` plus edge cases, and 2000 generated scripts)
and a 200,059-case run (`--seeds 200000`) agree exactly with upstream, including the
stream state and read position after every step. Things later ASCII/binary reader ports
must know:

- **ASCII readers depend on libstdc++ details.** `*GetInStreamPtr() >> x` is reproduced
  by `InputStream::extract_*` (sentry, `num_get`, `strtod`): no digits gives 0 with
  `failbit`; overflow clamps (`long` to `LONG_MIN/MAX`, `unsigned long` to `ULONG_MAX`,
  `double` to `±DBL_MAX`) with `failbit`; `>> unsigned long` accepts `-n` and negates
  modulo 2^64; `>> short`/`>> int` read a `long` and clamp; a failed sentry stores
  nothing. Once `failbit` or `eofbit` is set, every later extraction and `GoToNextLine`
  does nothing; upstream readers rarely check, so later values keep their old contents.
- **`GoToNextLine` = `ignore(256, '\n')` stops after 256 bytes without consuming the
  newline.** A line of 256+ bytes from the current position is therefore not finished:
  the next read starts on the same line.
- **`ReadType` word buffers are capped at 255 bytes, but only in optimised builds.** GCC
  11+ libstdc++ bounds `operator>>(istream&, char*)` with `__builtin_object_size` under
  `__OPTIMIZE__`. Upstream is built `-O2`, so the 256-byte `sBuff` takes 255 bytes and
  leaves the rest in the stream; at `-O0` the same code overflows the buffer. The port
  caps at 255 (`extract_word_limited`). Shim code built at `-O0` doesn't have the cap.
- **Binary short reads are undefined upstream.** `ReadLong`/`ReadLongs` (`version >= 40`)
  read into uninitialised locals and return `SM_SUCCESS` with garbage when the data ends.
  The port returns `SolidError::InvalidInput`; difftest compares only the status (`-2`)
  and the stream state in those cases.
- **LP64.** `long` is 8 bytes on the reference platform, so the `version < 40` and
  `>= 40` integer paths are identical and their range checks are dead. A file written on
  LLP64 Windows with `version < 40` (4-byte longs) would not read correctly upstream
  either.
- **`ReadBoolean` never byte-swaps, `ReadBooleans` does** (upstream asymmetry, kept).
  `ByteSwap32(unsigned short)` always returns 0, but nothing reaches it when
  `sizeof(short) == 2`.
