# Findings

Rust-vs-C++ disagreements, upstream bugs, nondeterminism and other facts later agents
need. Add entries under a heading per unit (or "General"); keep the newest at the end
of each section.

## General

- **Nondeterministic upstream paths.** `SmFace::GetPointsInFace` (asked for more than one
  point) and `SmShell.cpp` call `srand(time(NULL))`. Those paths can't be reproduced bit for
  bit. Difftests must avoid them, or compare only results that don't depend on the random
  draw. The Rust port draws from `kernel.rng` instead. (Reported by Wave 0 agents B and C;
  see `plan/closure.md` for the other hazards: pointer-keyed maps, global tolerances, and
  statics set by the first call.)
- **NLib global error record.** NLib routines return a flag and store the error number in
  the process-wide `NL_ERROR.eno` (`N_ErrSet`). Shims must call `N_ErrClear()` before the
  call and read `NL_ERROR.eno` after it. On the Rust side this is
  `SolidError::Nlib { code: NlibCode, .. }` (added to `crates/solidcore/src/error.rs` with
  `nlib.knots`). Normalise both sides to `nlib_<number>` in runners.
- **JSON can't hold NaN or inf.** difftest inputs are JSON, so generated cases can't contain
  non-finite parameters (serde turns NaN into `null`). Test robustness to non-finite input in
  Rust unit tests. Outputs may still be non-finite.
- **difftest report `seeds` field.** It records the `--seeds` CLI value, not the number of
  generated cases a runner actually produced. `nlib.knots` overrides `cases()` to always
  generate at least 1200.

## nlib.knots (green; no disagreements)

2953 default cases and a 51,753-case run (`--seeds 50000`) all agree bit for bit with
upstream (`max_rel_err = 0`). Upstream behaviour worth knowing:

- **`N_BasisEval` with a flag other than `NL_LEFT`/`NL_RIGHT`.** It ignores the
  `NL_CAL_ERR` from `N_BasisFindSpan` and reads an uninitialised span index (UB). Rust
  takes a `Side` enum, so this can't happen. The ffi wrappers reject other flags.
- **Out-of-bounds reads on short knot vectors.** Upstream span and basis routines read
  outside `U` when `m < 2p+1` (and `N_BasisEval` overflows its stack arrays when
  `p > NL_MAXDEG + 1`). Rust returns `SolidError::InvalidInput` for these. The ffi wrappers
  only pass inputs with `n_knots >= 2p+2`.
- **`N_BasisEval` on `NL_NUM_ERR`.** Upstream leaves `N` partly computed. Rust returns only
  the error. A later port that relies on the partial values would need a different API.
- **NL_LEFT/NL_RIGHT docs contradict the code.** The upstream comments say `NL_LEFT` means
  `U[spn] < u <= U[spn+1]`, but the code does the opposite: `NL_LEFT` gives
  `U[spn] <= u < U[spn+1]`. Rust `Side` documents what the code does.
- **`N_KnotVectorIsValid` accepts degenerate vectors.** It accepts a vector of `p+1` equal
  knots (for example `[2,2,2,2]` with p=3), and a single knot with p=0. Rust does the same,
  faithfully.
- **Zero-length end spans are skipped.** `N_BasisFindSpan` moves the end spans inward past
  zero-length spans (`U[i+1] < U[i] + 1e-12`, upstream note [B405]). `find_span_and_mult`
  therefore reports multiplicity `p+1` at the domain ends, whatever the real end
  multiplicity is.

## nlib.math (green; no disagreements)

3076 default cases (76 fixture + 3000 generated) and a 100,076-case run (`--seeds
100000`) agree bit for bit with upstream (`max_rel_err = 0`), across all 79 functions
(point/control-point arithmetic, `N_SolveQuadraticEq`, `N_FloatOpIsBad`, the real-matrix
routines, power-basis surfaces, reallocation). Upstream behaviour worth knowing:

- **No back-edge left.** `N_SrfPowerBasisEvalPt` calls `N_SrfGetCPts` and
  `N_SrfGetKnotVectors` (unit `nlib.srf_basic`) only to read the control net; the knot
  vectors are unused. `N_SrfPowerBasisEvalDerivs` reads `spl->p`, `spl->q` and the net
  directly. The Rust functions take the net (and degrees) instead of an `NL_SURFACE`, so
  nothing is stubbed; the difftest drives the C++ through a real `NL_SURFACE`. When
  `nlib.srf_basic` lands, a `Surface` method can forward to these.
- **Banded matrices with an even bandwidth** index one column past the row
  (`j - i + bw/2` reaches `bw`), and an in-place banded transpose writes past its new
  `(n+1)`-column rows when `bw > n + 1`. Triangular operands that are not square read
  outside their rows in `N_RealMatrixMultiply`/`Transpose`/`MultiplyPtArray`. Rust
  returns `InvalidInput` for all of these; the ffi wrappers only pass odd bandwidths and
  square triangular/banded matrices.
- **`N_SrfPowerBasisEvalDerivs` overflows `up[NL_MAXDEG+1]`.** It stores the v-power rows
  after the `p+1` u-powers in the same 18-entry stack array, so e.g. bicubic with `vdr = 3`
  (`p + 1 + min(vdr,q)*(q+1) + q > 17`) writes past it. Rust returns `InvalidInput`.
- **`N_SrfPowerBasisEvalDerivs` rational upper-half quirk.** The final loop tests
  `k1 == vdr` (a leftover loop variable, `(k2+1)*(q+1)`) instead of `udr == vdr`. The port
  keeps it. With `udr > vdr` it can read past `SD`/`CwDers` (Rust: `InvalidInput`; the
  ffi wrapper rejects rational `mfl` cases with `udr > vdr`).
- **Uninitialised storage.** NLib allocates with `malloc`; triangular results only fill
  their triangle and `N_Realloc*` leaves new entries unset. Rust zero-fills. difftest
  compares the *defined region* of each result (the entries upstream writes).
- **`N_RealMatrixIsNULL` treats `bw <= 0` as null**, so a full result of a 1x1 product
  (`bw = na = 0`) is reallocated when reused as an output. Ported as is.
- **`N_RealMatrixTranspose` in place, full type**, leaks the old storage (the free is after
  `NL_OUT`). No effect on results.
- **Globals.** `NLIBCHKBYPASS` (only `M_NoErrChk` sets it; nothing calls that) is treated
  as 0. `NL_MTOL` is a parameter of `CPoint::approx_eq` because `N_SrfIsClosedSmooth`
  temporarily overrides it around `N_SrfIsClosed`.
